## Lift Rentals

A simple web application which allows users to sign in Facebook and make a post for rental/selling industrial tools.

The technologies used for the project include Angular 6, NodeJS, Mongodb, Express and Amazon EC2, Docker for deployment 

There are many times where people buy a equipment or tool to use and never really got the full potential from it. As sometimes these tools are only used once for a certain task and may never be needed again. In that case this application was developed to help users use a simple UI to create a certain post. This is the simple page with the two main function buttons SignIn, Create Post.
